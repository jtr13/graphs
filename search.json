Think of the old style lego kits that give you building blocks with which you can make whatever you want. To make the most of the package, it‚Äôs very helpful to think of it in these terms. Rather than think in terms of names of charts, think in terms of the graphical elements that are needed to create that type of chart. With knowledge of how to put together the basic elements you will be able to create anything you want.\nThis is a Quarto book.\nTo learn more about Quarto books visit https://quarto.org/docs/books."

If your data is is not in data frame form, you‚Äôll need to convert it to a data frame first. How can you tell if you have the right format? Use class to check:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nclass(faithful)\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n\nclass(CO2)\n\n[1] \"nfnGroupedData\" \"nfGroupedData\"  \"groupedData\"    \"data.frame\"    \n\nclass(diamonds)\n\n[1] \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n\nclass(Titanic)\n\n[1] \"table\"\n\nclass(Seatbelts)\n\n[1] \"mts\"    \"ts\"     \"matrix\" \"array\" \n\n\nAs long as data.frame is one of the classes returned, you‚Äôre good to go. So faithful and CO2, two of the built-in base R datasets would work, as would diamonds a dataset that comes with the ggplot2 package. Note that class(diamonds) also returns tbl_df and tbl indications that diamonds is also a tibble, the tidyverse version of a data frame. We‚Äôll return to this topic later. Neither Titanic nor Seatbelts is a data frame so both would produce errors if we tried to create graphs from this data with ggplot2 without converting the data. If you read data from a file with read.csv(), read_csv(), or other functions for reading tabular data, it will be a data.frame."

There are a limited number of aesthetic mappings; some of the most common are x, y, color, and fill. For example, to create the following scatterplot, we map x to Income and y to Illiteracy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each geom, there is a small set of required mappings and a much larger set of optional mappings. The catch is that sometimes it may not be clear which mappings are required. In this guide we will always make a special point of indicating the required mappings, as this can be a stumbling block for beginners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhenever you learn a new geom, pay careful attention to the required mappings.\n\n\nLet‚Äôs consider an example. geom_histogram() has one required mapping x or y. A standard histogram with vertical bars is produced by mapping x though there may be circumstances in which a y mapping is desired, for example to create a population pyramid."

    "text": "3.4 Continuous vs.¬†discrete mappings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon‚Äôt skip this section.\n\n\n\nIt‚Äôs really important. ü§ì\n\n\nIn addition to knowing the required mappings, it is critical to know whether the the visual component (x, y, fill, color, etc.) must be mapped to a continuous (think numerical) variable, discrete (think categorical) variable, or either one. If you‚Äôre working with columns in a data frame you will likely know their data types, but there are times when you‚Äôll need to check that the data types are correct. There are many ways to check; depending on the method, continuous columns will be marked as numeric, num, dbl, integer, or dbl. Discrete mappings will appear as: factor, character, chr, Factor, fct, Ord.factor, ord, logi, logical, lgl, to indicate that the variable is a character, factor, or logical. (The differences among the terms within each group are not important at the moment.)\nLet‚Äôs consider the built-in dataset CO2. Try running the code shown below for practice.\nRecall that we first must be sure that we‚Äôre working with a data frame:\n\nclass(CO2)\n\n[1] \"nfnGroupedData\" \"nfGroupedData\"  \"groupedData\"    \"data.frame\"    \n\n\nNow let‚Äôs look at the data types of the columns with str():\n\nstr(CO2)\n\nClasses 'nfnGroupedData', 'nfGroupedData', 'groupedData' and 'data.frame':  84 obs. of  5 variables:\n $ Plant    : Ord.factor w/ 12 levels \"Qn1\"&lt;\"Qn2\"&lt;\"Qn3\"&lt;..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 ...\n $ Type     : Factor w/ 2 levels \"Quebec\",\"Mississippi\": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ Treatment: Factor w/ 2 levels \"nonchilled\",\"chilled\": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ conc     : num  95 175 250 350 500 675 1000 95 175 250 ...\n $ uptake   : num  16 30.4 34.8 37.2 35.3 39.2 39.7 13.6 27.3 37.1 ...\n - attr(*, \"formula\")=Class 'formula'  language uptake ~ conc | Plant\n  .. ..- attr(*, \".Environment\")=&lt;environment: R_EmptyEnv&gt; \n - attr(*, \"outer\")=Class 'formula'  language ~Treatment * Type\n  .. ..- attr(*, \".Environment\")=&lt;environment: R_EmptyEnv&gt; \n - attr(*, \"labels\")=List of 2\n  ..$ x: chr \"Ambient carbon dioxide concentration\"\n  ..$ y: chr \"CO2 uptake rate\"\n - attr(*, \"units\")=List of 2\n  ..$ x: chr \"(uL/L)\"\n  ..$ y: chr \"(umol/m^2 s)\"\n\n\nNote that both conc and uptake have data type num which is continuous, while Plant, Type and Treatment have data types Factor or Ord.factor which are discrete.\nAnother method is to use glimpse() from the dplyr package, which is similar to str() but shows more data and less attribute information:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nglimpse(CO2)\n\nRows: 84\nColumns: 5\n$ Plant     &lt;ord&gt; Qn1, Qn1, Qn1, Qn1, Qn1, Qn1, Qn1, Qn2, Qn2, Qn2, Qn2, Qn2, ‚Ä¶\n$ Type      &lt;fct&gt; Quebec, Quebec, Quebec, Quebec, Quebec, Quebec, Quebec, Queb‚Ä¶\n$ Treatment &lt;fct&gt; nonchilled, nonchilled, nonchilled, nonchilled, nonchilled, ‚Ä¶\n$ conc      &lt;dbl&gt; 95, 175, 250, 350, 500, 675, 1000, 95, 175, 250, 350, 500, 6‚Ä¶\n$ uptake    &lt;dbl&gt; 16.0, 30.4, 34.8, 37.2, 35.3, 39.2, 39.7, 13.6, 27.3, 37.1, ‚Ä¶\n\n\nWe see that glimpse() labels the continuous (numeric) columns as &lt;dbl&gt; rather than num and the discrete columns as &lt;fct&gt; and &lt;ord&gt;. Again, for our purposes, this distinction isn‚Äôt important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nView() and head() ‚Äì common methods for looking at data ‚Äì do NOT show data types so should not be used in this situation.\n\n\n\n3.4.1 An example\nSuppose we wish to draw histograms of the continuous variables in the CO2 dataset. Since histogram represents the distribution of a numerical variable and has no meaning for categorical variables, the mapping must be to a numerical variable. Our choices therefore are conc and uptake:\n\n\n\n¬†\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†\n\n\n\n\n\n¬†\n\n\n\nIf we try to try, though, to draw a histogram of a discrete variable, such as Plant, we‚Äôll get an error:\n\n\nError in `geom_histogram()`:\n! Problem while computing stat.\n‚Ñπ Error occurred in the 1st layer.\nCaused by error in `setup_params()`:\n! `stat_bin()` requires a continuous x aesthetic\n‚úñ the x aesthetic is discrete.\n‚Ñπ Perhaps you want `stat=\"count\"`?\n\n\nWe‚Äôre ready now to combine the three essentials of a layer‚Äìdata, an aesthetic mapping, and a geom‚Äìto create our first plot."
